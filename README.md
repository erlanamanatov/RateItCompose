# RateIt Compose

## :scroll: Description
A little app that was built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).  It contains only one screen with custom animated content.

The goal of the app is to explore [Animation API](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation) and [Canvas API](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/graphics/Canvas) of Jetpack Compose.

Inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/Cuberto/rate-it).
